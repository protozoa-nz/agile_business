# Stability - Flexibility

<aside class='notes'>
  When I think about healthy patterns, I often think about the balance of flexibility and stability

<aside class='notes'>
  The hip joint has lots of stability - very hard to dislocate.
  It is not very flexible.
  It provides an excellent platform for the rest of the body to rely on

<aside class='notes'>
  The human shoulder is highly flexible - compatatively easy to dislocate.
  It is not very stable.
  It can perform an amazing range of movements and functions.

Natural History

<aside class='notes'>
  Natual history is a precursor to modern science - it started out as a bunch of rich people who had enough surplus resource to be able to be curious.
  They got to talking and tinkering.
  It built on itself

Science

<aside class='notes'>
  The modern scientific pattern is basically the same.
  Some of the steps have added more stability - like more formal peer review before publication.
  But the process preserves flexibility of thought.

  Well, mostly - in some fields it's joked that you have to wait for the old guard to die out before thinking can progress.

<aside class='notes'>
  This is a gross simplification (apologies to desingers).
  The process is roughly the same (as science).
  Quesiton asking, testing, then looping again.

<aside class='notes'>
  Modern software is pretty much the same iterative pattern.
  We iterate because we are humble enough to admit that we don't know what the solution is.

  Let's look at iteration as a journey instead of a process loop.

  Here's what an agile development process might look like :
    - You've got a goal you want to reach (the top of that distant mountain)

  You plan a step (sprint) in the direction of your goal

<aside class='notes'>
  You march towards that goal, and along the way:
    - you get a little off the mark
    - you spot a masive crevasse ahead

  At the end of your march / spring / fortnight, you set up camp.
  You reflect on the journey so far (retrospective)

  Given your learnings, you:
    - plan another sprint
    - execute

  What's that new thing on the horizon?
  Note that with this iterative approach, you might learn you were aiming for the wrong peak... or it was not a peak that you needed at all.
  Or you might also find your destination was closer than anticipated.
